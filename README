TODO:

- Make Blogger oauth2 refresh work?

NICE
- Clean up API (URLs nicer)
- HTTPS Everywhere
- See how you can add Like buttons. Maybe group-specific images
  that are at like rss-image.cgi and wrap a link around that
  increments then redirects back?
- Delete users and groups
- Investigate the RSS feed that RSS readers tend to produce for
  "share" action, see if that needs any special support
- Fix sorting across Wordpress and Blogger. Looks like different servers report different times?

DONE
- Make useful author bylines that indicate the origin properly (it's OK)
- Unicode support: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9322410/set-encoding-in-python-3-cgi-scripts
- Add adding of users to groups
- Handle authentication for group members:
  First pass, add a password field to users. Fill it with, say, 64
  base64 characters, randomly generated. Also a username field and
  generate it, maybe. Show these in the group UI, for now, and the
  generated RSS URL. Make rss-groups.cgi require a matching
  username/password to return the results.
- Get Wordpress authentication working right (crazy webhook thing instead of logins)
- Get Blogger authentication working right (and what does that actually mean?)
  - It looks like the only way will be to have the particular user
     authenticate this server to read. This means that users will have
     to have their own pages where they can edit stuff.
- Support differing public/private levels
- Clean up code enough to trust first group (good enough I think, but needs more HTTPS)
