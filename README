TODO:

- Get Blogger authentication working right (and what does that actually mean?)
- Get Wordpress authentication working right (so logins, then?)

NICE
- See how you can add Like buttons. Maybe group-specific images
  that are at like rss-image.cgi and wrap a link around that
  increments then redirects back?
- Delete users and groups

DONE
- Make useful author bylines that indicate the origin properly (it's OK)
- Unicode support: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9322410/set-encoding-in-python-3-cgi-scripts
- Add adding of users to groups
- Handle authentication for group members:
  First pass, add a password field to users. Fill it with, say, 64
  base64 characters, randomly generated. Also a username field and
  generate it, maybe. Show these in the group UI, for now, and the
  generated RSS URL. Make rss-groups.cgi require a matching
  username/password to return the results.
