    <h1>RSS Groups</h1>
    <p>This is the first RSS Groups implementation.</p>

    <p>If you are Eric, you can manage groups <a
      href="https://eric.willisson.org/rss-groups/group/">here.</a></p>

    <p>If you are not, then you should have been given a link to a more specific
      place, but here are some thoughts.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My goal in this is to make it possible for groups of people to
      have private blogs which it is easy to stay up to date with. The
      Streams of the 2010s have shown the value of collecting all the
      posts from people into one place, and allowing new people to
      join that "one place." The trouble with a group of friends all
      subscribed to each other's blogs over RSS is that it's difficult
      for a new person to be added to everybody's.
    </p>

    <p>This tool combines RSS feeds together into one. I hope this
      will make it easy to create a new group, for any interest.
    </p>

    <p>I seek to interoperate with existing systems. So, instead of
      this being a publishing platform itself, it understands RSS and
      some other blog formats. To join a group, first, make a blog. If
      you wish, make it private. Then, tell the group owner. They will
      send you a link to your private user page, where you can enter
      in the blog's RSS feed URL, and you will be given an RSS feed to
      subscribe to. That's it! From that point on, you should be able
      to read the posts from everyone in the group, and new members
      who join will be added seamlessly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, since a blog's privacy settings are generally
      managed by the blog platform itself, you will have to share your
      blog, if it is private, with other members in the group
      individually. This will be needed if you want to let them, for
      example, read comments, or generally read your blog outside of
      their RSS reader.
    </p>

    <p>This is currently a very early beta. Its UI has no polish at
      all, and there are some questionable security practices. There
      are a lot of improvements I want to make, but I also wanted to
      see it in use as quickly as possible so I could know where to
      focus my efforts. Here is an incomplete list of additions I
      would like to make:
      <ul>
	<li>Self-service groups and user addition</li>
	<li>Separate authentication for user profiles versus group RSS
	  access</li>
	<li>Volume control for individual users in the group ("show me
	  less of this person's posts")</li>
	<li>Integration with RSS readers' "shared" feeds</li>
	<li>An optional "+1" system</li>
	<li>Support for lots more locked-down blogs. Tumblr, maybe</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>So, what's the security story?</h2>
    <p>
      The overall idea is that this server could be run by anyone
      (perhaps someone could set up a service to provide it, to lower
      the barrier to entry). Whoever controls the server, of course,
      will need to be trusted by the group. Members of the group also
      can easily show someone else their feeds, so there will need to
      be intra-group trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual blogs within a group are the only accounts on the
      system. If you have many individual groups, you're treated
      completely differently for each one. In each group, for each
      blog, you have a randomly-generated authorization string. This
      is immutable and is required both to make changes to your
      account settings, and to view the RSS Group itself (unless it is
      public). The authorization string should be unguessable, but if
      it's stolen, the thief has full access to everything you
      would. The string is sometimes stored in URL parameters and
      sometimes in short-lived cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no special encryption added anywhere. Everything should
      be done over HTTPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use a Blogger blog, you have to sign in with Google, and
      the server uses standard OAuth2 practices to keep a token alive
      so it can keep reading from the blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a lot of possible improvements. For one, separate
      authorization strings for changing user settings and reading the
      RSS Group would mean that someone having the string stolen
      wouldn't necessarily be able to have their account changed
      maliciously.
