    <h1>RSS Groups</h1>
    <p>This is the first RSS Groups implementation.</p>

    <p>If you are Eric, you can manage groups <a
      href="group/">here.</a></p>

    <p>If you are not, then you should have been given a link to a more specific
      place, but here are some thoughts.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My goal in this is to make it possible for groups of people to
      have private blogs which it is easy to stay up to date with. The
      Streams of the 2010s have shown the value of collecting all the
      posts from people into one place, and allowing new people to
      join that "one place." The trouble with a group of friends all
      subscribed to each other's blogs over RSS is that it's difficult
      for a new person to be added to everybody's.
    </p>

    <p>This tool combines RSS feeds together into one. I hope this
      will make it easy to create a new group, for any interest.
    </p>

    <p>I seek to interoperate with existing systems. So, instead of
      this being a publishing platform itself, it understands RSS and
      some other blog formats. To join a group, first, make a blog. If
      you wish, make it private. Then, tell the group owner. They will
      send you a link to your private user page, where you can enter
      in the blog's RSS feed URL, and you will be given an RSS feed to
      subscribe to. That's it! From that point on, you should be able
      to read the posts from everyone in the group, and new members
      who join will be added seamlessly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, since a blog's privacy settings are generally
      managed by the blog platform itself, you will have to share your
      blog, if it is private, with other members in the group
      individually. This will be needed if you want to let them, for
      example, read comments, or generally read your blog outside of
      their RSS reader.
    </p>

    <p>This is currently a very early beta. Its UI has no polish at
      all, and there are some questionable security practices. There
      are a lot of improvements I want to make, but I also wanted to
      see it in use as quickly as possible so I could know where to
      focus my efforts. Here is an incomplete list of additions I
      would like to make:
      <ul>
	<li>Self-service groups and user addition</li>
	<li>Separate authentication for user profiles versus group RSS
	  access</li>
	<li>Volume control for individual users in the group ("show me
	  less of this person's posts")</li>
	<li>Integration with RSS readers' "shared" feeds</li>
	<li>An optional "+1" system</li>
      </ul>
